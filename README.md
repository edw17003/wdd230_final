# WDD230 Final Project
This is a mock company website for "Bountiful Foods", which sells fresh produce, fruits, drinks, desserts, etc.

## Design Specifications
The website consists of three pages: Home, Fresh, and About Us. It uses design principles such as PARC and wayfinding to keep the user focused on the main message of the webite, which is to promote the local area and encourage the user to purchase drink mixes.
